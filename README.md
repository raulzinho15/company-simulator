# company-simulator
The GitHub repository for the personal project clicker game, Company Simulator. This game showcases an account login/signup system with basic encryption, a tutorial section for teaching players the mechanics of the game, and a main game screen.

To play, compile the .java files, and run the class compiled from the src/application/Main.java file. A login screen should open, and at the bottom right there will be a link to make an account. Click this, and make an account. Please note, passwords are stored locally with basic Caesar Cipher encryption, so be wary of the password you choose. Once you make an account, log in, and you will be led to the tutorial. Once the tutorial is played, the main game screen will open.

All the code used was authored by Raul Hernandez in 2018 using Eclipse IDE.
